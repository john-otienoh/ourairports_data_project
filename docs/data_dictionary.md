OurAirports
OurAirports dataset formats
This page documents the columns used in the open-data datasets described on the Downloads page. There is more information there about using the data, including terms of use, and working around Microsoft Excel's UTF-8 handling for CSV files.

All of the following datasets use the comma-separated values (CSV) format, and UTF-8 character encoding.

 Dataset: airports.csv
Each row in this dataset represents the record for a single airport. The primary key for interoperability purposes with other datasets is ident, but the actual internal OurAirports primary key is id. iso_region is a foreign key into the regions.csv download file.

Column	Sample value	Description
id	2434	Internal OurAirports integer identifier for the airport. This will stay persistent, even if the airport code changes.
ident	EGLL	The text identifier used in the OurAirports URL. This will be the ICAO code if available. Otherwise, it will be a local airport code (if no conflict), or if nothing else is available, an internally-generated code starting with the ISO2 country code, followed by a dash and a four-digit number.
type	large_airport	The type of the airport. Allowed values are "balloonport", "closed_airport", "heliport", "large_airport", "medium_airport", "seaplane_base", and "small_airport". See the map legend for a definition of each type.
name	London Heathrow Airport	The official airport name, including "Airport", "Airstrip", etc.
latitude_deg	51.470600	The airport latitude in decimal degrees (positive for north).
longitude_deg	-0.461941	The airport longitude in decimal degrees (positive for east).
elevation_ft	83	The airport elevation MSL in feet (not metres).
continent	EU	The code for the continent where the airport is (primarily) located. Allowed values are "AF" (Africa), "AN" (Antarctica), "AS" (Asia), "EU" (Europe), "NA" (North America), "OC" (Oceania), or "SA" (South America).
iso_country	GB	The two-character ISO 3166:1-alpha2 code for the country where the airport is (primarily) located. A handful of unofficial, non-ISO codes are also in use, such as "XK" for Kosovo. Points to the code column in countries.csv.
iso_region	GB-ENG	An alphanumeric code for the high-level administrative subdivision of a country where the airport is primarily located (e.g. province, governorate), prefixed by the ISO2 country code and a hyphen. OurAirports uses ISO 3166:2 codes whenever possible, preferring higher administrative levels, but also includes some custom codes. See the documentation for regions.csv.
municipality	London	The primary municipality that the airport serves (when available). Note that this is not necessarily the municipality where the airport is physically located.
scheduled_service	yes	"yes" if the airport currently has scheduled airline service; "no" otherwise.
gps_code	EGLL	The code that an aviation GPS database (such as Jeppesen's or Garmin's) would normally use for the airport. This will always be the icao_code if the airport has one, but it is not guaranteed to be globally unique.
icao_code	EGLL	The four-letter ICAO code for the airport (if it has one).
iata_code	LHR	The three-letter IATA code for the airport (if it has one).
local_code		The local country code for the airport, if different from the gps_code, icao_code, and iata_code fields (used mainly for US airports).
home_link	http://www.heathrowairport.com/	URL of the airport's official home page on the web, if one exists.
wikipedia_link	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport	URL of the airport's page on Wikipedia, if one exists.

 Dataset: airport-frequencies.csv
Each row in this dataset represents a single airport radio frequency for voice communication (radio navigation aids appear in navaids.csv). The column airport_ident is a foreign key referencing the ident column in airports.csv for the associated airport.

Column	Sample value	Description
id	54836	Internal OurAirports integer identifier for the frequency. This will stay persistent, even if the radio frequency or description changes.
airport_ref	3206	Internal integer foreign key matching the id column for the associated airport in airports.csv. (airport_ident is a better alternative.)
airport_ident	HKJK	Externally-visible string foreign key matching the ident column for the associated airport in airports.csv.
type	TWR	A code for the frequency type. This isn't (currently) a controlled vocabulary, but probably will be soon. Some common values are "TWR" (tower), "ATF" or "CTAF" (common traffic frequency), "GND" (ground control), "RMP" (ramp control), "ATIS" (automated weather), "RCO" (remote radio outlet), "ARR" (arrivals), "DEP" (departures), "UNICOM" (monitored ground station), and "RDO" (a flight-service station).
description	Nairobi tower	A description of the frequency, typically the way a pilot would open a call on it.
frequency_mhz	118.7	Radio voice frequency in megahertz. Note that the same frequency may appear multiple times for an airport, serving different functions.
 Dataset: runways.csv
Each row in this dataset represents a single airport landing surface (runway, helipad, or waterway). The initial fields apply to the entire surface, in both directions. Fields beginning with le_* apply only to the low-numbered end of the runway (e.g. 09), while fields beginning with he_* apply only to the high-numbered end of the runway (e.g. 27).

Column	Sample value	Description
id	234512	Internal OurAirports integer identifier for the runway. This will stay persistent, even if the runway numbering changes.
airport_ref	1941	Internal integer foreign key matching the id column for the associated airport in airports.csv. (airport_ident is a better alternative.)
airport_ident	CYVR	Externally-visible string foreign key matching the ident column for the associated airport in airports.csv.
length_ft	9940	Length of the full runway surface (including displaced thresholds, overrun areas, etc) in feet.

 Dataset: navaids.csv
Each row in this dataset represents a single radio navigation. When the navaid is associated with an airport, the associated_airport field links to the ident field in airports.csv.

Column	Sample value	Description
id	86738	Internal OurAirports integer identifier for the navaid. This will stay persistent, even if the navaid identifier or frequency changes.
filename	Christchurch_VOR-DME_NZ	This is a unique string identifier constructed from the navaid name and country, and used in the OurAirports URL.
ident	CH	The 1-3 character identifer that the navaid transmits.
name	Christchurch	The name of the navaid, excluding its type.
type	VOR-DME	The type of the navaid. Options are "DME", "NDB", "NDB-DME", "TACAN", "VOR", "VOR-DME", or "VORTAC". See the map legend for more information about each type.
frequency_khz	115300	The frequency of the navaid in kilohertz. If the Navaid operates on the VHF band (VOR, VOR-DME) or operates on the UHF band with a paired VHF frequency (DME, TACAN, VORTAC), the you need to divide this number by 1,000 to get the frequency in megahertz (115.3 MHz in this example). For an NDB or NDB-DME, you can use this frequency directly.
latitude_deg	-43.504101	The latitude of the navaid in decimal degrees (negative for south).
longitude_deg	172.514999	The longitude of the navaid in decimal degrees (negative for west).
elevation_ft	123	The navaid's elevation MSL in feet (not metres).
iso_country	NZ	The two-character ISO 3166:1-alpha2 code for the country that operates the navaid. A handful of unofficial, non-ISO codes are also in use, such as "XK" for Kosovo.
dme_frequency_khz	115300	The paired VHF frequency for the DME (or TACAN) in kilohertz. Divide by 1,000 to get the paired VHF frequency in megahertz (e.g. 115.3 MHz).
dme_channel	100X	The DME channel (an alternative way of tuning distance-measuring equipment).
dme_latitude_deg	-43.504200	The latitude of the associated DME in decimal degrees (negative for south). If missing, assume that the value is the same as latitude_deg.
dme_longitude_deg	172.515000	The longitude of the associated DME in decimal degrees (negative for west). If missing, assume that the value is the same as longitude_deg.
dme_elevation_ft	140	The associated DME transmitters elevation MSL in feet. If missing, assume that it's the same value as elevation_ft.
slaved_variation_deg	23.007	The magnetic variation adjustment built into a VOR's, VOR-DME's, or TACAN's radials. Positive means east (added to the true direction), and negative means west (subtracted from the true direction). This will not usually be the same as magnetic-variation because the magnetic pole is constantly in motion.
magnetic_variation_deg	23.188	The actual magnetic variation at the navaid's location. Positive means east (added to the true direction), and negative means west (subtracted from the true direction).
usageType	BOTH	The primary function of the navaid in the airspace system. Options include "HI" (high-altitude airways, at or above flight level 180), "LO" (low-altitude airways), "BOTH" (high- and low-altitude airways), "TERM" (terminal-area navigation only), and "RNAV" (non-GPS area navigation).
power	HIGH	The power-output level of the navaid. Options include "HIGH", "MEDIUM", "LOW", and "UNKNOWN".
